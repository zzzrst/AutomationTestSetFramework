# Overview
Please take a few minutes to review the overview below before diving into the code.

## AutomationTestSetFramework
Through the use of dependency injection, we aim to use this framework as the central runner of test sets / cases / steps.
With the use of interfaces, the behavior of how test sets / cases / steps will be run can be easily tested.
